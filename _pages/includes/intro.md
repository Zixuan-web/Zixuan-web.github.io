Hello! I am currently a Master’s student in Materials Science and Engineering at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/). I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Yongji Gong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=QrStbPIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) in [Gong Group](https://www.buaamsegong.net/).

Before joining Beihang University, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Engineering from [National University of Defense Technology](https://www.nudt.edu.cn/).

I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities, and my research interests include:

Solid-state batteries
Lithium and sodium metal anodes
Interface engineering in energy storage systems
Solid-state electrolyte materials design and optimization
If you are interested in my research or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me via email: [m15095165012@gmail.com](mailto:m15095165012@gmail.com).
